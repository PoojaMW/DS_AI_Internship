    " 1 Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of explicitly programming every rule. In traditional programming, we provide the computer with both the data and the rules to generate an output. However, in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with data and the correct answers (labels), and the system automatically discovers the rules or patterns that connect them. This allows machines to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Instead of being manually programmed for every situation, ML models improve their performance by learning from experience."
